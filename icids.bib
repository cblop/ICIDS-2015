	abstract = {Interactive narrative environments offer significant potential for creating engaging narrative experiences that are tailored to individual users. Increasingly, applications in education, training, and entertainment are leveraging narrative to create rich interactive experiences in virtual storyworlds. A key challenge posed by these environments is devising accurate models of director agents’ strategies that determine the most appropriate director action to perform for crafting customized story experiences. A promising approach is developing an empirically informed model of director agents’ decision-making strategies. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning models of director agent decision-making strategies by observing human-human interactions in an interactive narrative-centered learning environment. The results are encouraging and suggest that creating empirically driven models of director agent decision-making is a promising approach to interactive narrative.},

	abstract = {Marlinspike is an interactive drama system. It produces a story by playing short pre-authored story components called scenes in response to the actions of a human player. Marlinspike selects the next scene to play so as to reincorporate — or narratively build upon — as much of the story-so-far as possible. In accordance with an Aristotelian definition of narrative unity, this reincorporation serves to make earlier events--particularly the player's actions--narratively necessary to the finished story. An evaluation with human players of Marlinspike's novel reincorporation feature produced mixed results. On the one hand, reincorporation does indeed produce internal story structures that are more unified and that include more of the players' significant actions. However, the players themselves did not report a correspondingly improved experience of either story quality or story-level agency.},
